# Iron Mint Design Principles

**Context**: Iron Mint is Niko's personal development environment setup using Nix flakes, designed to provide a reproducible, comprehensive dev environment while respecting existing user configurations.

## Core Design Principles

1. **üìÅ Centralized Configuration**: Keep as much configuration as possible in the `~/dev/iron-mint/` directory
   - All custom configs live in `config/` subdirectory (vimrc, zshrc, gitconfig-dev, etc.)
   - Nix flake defines the complete environment declaratively
   - Users can inspect, modify, and understand the full setup in one location

2. **üè† Preserve Existing Behavior**: Layer Iron Mint on top of user's existing setup, don't replace it
   - **Dotfiles**: Append source lines to existing `.vimrc`, `.zshrc`, `.gitconfig` rather than replacing them
   - **PATH**: Preserve existing PATH, add Iron Mint tools alongside user's tools
   - **Conditional Git Config**: Only apply Iron Mint git settings to `~/dev/` directory using `includeIf`
   - **Idempotent Setup**: Safe to run install multiple times without breaking existing configs

3. **üîÑ Comprehensive Backup & Restore**: Always provide a way back to the original state
   - **Timestamped Backups**: Every dotfile change backed up to `~/.dotfiles-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`
   - **Uninstall Script**: `--uninstall` flag provides guided restoration from backups  
   - **Backup Validation**: Track which files were created vs. modified by Iron Mint
   - **Non-destructive**: Never delete user data, only modify configuration files

## Implementation Patterns

**Dotfiles Strategy**: Layered configuration approach
- Existing user configs remain intact
- Iron Mint configs sourced conditionally from `~/dev/iron-mint/config/`
- Example: `.vimrc` gets `source ~/dev/iron-mint/config/vimrc` appended
- Allows users to override Iron Mint settings in their existing configs

**Nix Build Process**: 
- `nix build .#dotfiles` generates setup script dynamically
- Setup script embedded as heredoc in `flake.nix` for transparency
- Single source of truth for all installation logic

**Safety Mechanisms**:
- Check for existing configurations before modifying
- Idempotent operations (safe to run multiple times)
- Comprehensive backup system with guided restore process
- Clear separation between user configs and Iron Mint configs

**Recognition Signal**: When working on environment setup or configuration management projects, apply these principles to respect user agency while providing powerful defaults.
