# Iron Mint Profile Configuration
# This file is sourced by ~/.zprofile or ~/.bash_profile when Iron Mint is installed
# Works with both zsh and bash login shells

# Add Iron Mint (Nix) tools to PATH with higher priority than Homebrew
# This needs to happen in profile (login shell) so it's available before interactive shell starts
