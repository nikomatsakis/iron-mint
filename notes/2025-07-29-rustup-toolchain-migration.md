# Rust Toolchain Migration - July 29, 2025

## Migration: Manual Rustup → Proto-Managed Rust

### Problem
- Had manual rustup installation alongside proto
- Inconsistent tool management (Node/Python via proto, Rust via manual rustup)
- Wanted unified tool management approach

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed manual rustup**: `rustup self uninstall`
2. **Installed Rust via proto**: `proto install rust stable`
3. **Verified proto's Rust approach**: Proto manages rustup under the hood

### How Proto's Rust Integration Works
- **Different from Node/Python**: No proto shims created
- **Uses standard Rust toolchain**: Leverages rustup's native project detection
- **Project-specific versions**: Uses `rust-toolchain.toml` files (standard Rust approach)
- **Global management**: Proto installs/manages rustup and toolchain versions

### Verification Results ✅
- **Global version**: `rustc 1.88.0` (stable) 
- **Project-specific**: `rustc 1.87.0` (via `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- **Automatic switching**: Works as expected when entering/leaving project directories
- **Standard workflow**: Follows Rust ecosystem conventions

### Configuration
- **Global config**: `~/.prototools` has `rust = "stable"`
- **Project config**: Use `rust-toolchain.toml` files in project roots
- **Tool location**: Rust tools remain in `~/.cargo/bin/` (managed by proto's rustup)

### Benefits Achieved
✅ **Unified tool management** - All languages now managed by proto  
✅ **Standard Rust workflow** - Uses `rust-toolchain.toml` as expected  
✅ **Project-specific versions** - Automatic switching works correctly  
✅ **Consistent with Iron Mint** - Aligns with proto-based tool management approach

**Recognition Signal**: Proto's Rust integration is unique - it manages rustup installations but relies on Rust's native toolchain detection rather than creating shims. This is actually the correct approach for Rust ecosystem compatibility.
